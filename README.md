ILIE-GABRIEL MOLDOVAN

This project is trying to combine the drpciv.ro/dlexam and scoalarutiera.ro websites into one application


First iteration:

Built the front page, login page, and register page.
Built the data base.
Added the login and register functionalities


PLAN FOR THE SECOND ITERATION:

Add an admin panel: CRUD on the questions for the questionnaires, ability to manage the users
Add a profile for the user - will be able to see stats, statistics and more
Update the data base so that it holds the stats of the users


PLAN FOR THE THIRD ITERATION:

Add as many questions as possible
Make the questionnaires functionality work
Make a functionality for the admin panel to export the questions into a JSON file and use that JSON file to load the questions into a new data base (like a back-up) 


PLAN FOR THE FORTH ITERATION:

Finish to add the questions for all categories


PLAN FOR THE FIFTH ITERATION:

Start to add the learning environment: legislation, road signs, etc


PLEASE NOTE: this application is a personal project that I'm building to learn and experiment new things
